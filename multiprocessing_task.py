# Part 1: Multiprocessing with CPU-bound Tasks
#   In this part, you will use multiprocessing to process a file containing a list of large numbers and calculate whether each number is prime. This task will involve splitting the data across multiple processes to fully utilize the CPU.

#     Steps:
#     1 Upload the data:
#        Upload a file (numbers.txt) containing a list of large numbers (one per line) to GitHub repository.
#        Download the file in your Python code using a URL.
    
#     2. Process the file using multiprocessing:
#        Create a function that reads the file, divides the data into chunks, and uses the multiprocessing.Pool to calculate whether each number is prime.
#        Use the is_prime function to check if a number is prime.
